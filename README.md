# TrainTracker
This app allows you to keep track of different train schedules.

## How it works
TrainTracker utilizes Firebase to host arrival times and time to next departure data. Users will be able to add a train and destination to the list of tracked trains.

## Libraries used
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) is what TrainTracker uses to convert time to a readable, relevant format for the user.
